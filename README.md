Challenge 2: Chutes and Ladders
Implement a method that simulates how long it takes to finish a chutes and ladders game. Note that players use once six-sided die to roll and progress that corresponding number of spaces on the game board. There are 100 spaces in total. To finish the game, a player must land exactly on the 100 square. Along the way, players may land on spaces that take them much higher or much lower. The dictionary for spaces is below.

Bonus: Produce a distribution plot for the average number of turns it takes to complete a game over a user-specified number of simulations.
